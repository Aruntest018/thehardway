# Extra Credit 
# 1. Read about ordinal and cardinal numbers online.
# 2. With what you know of the difference between these types of numbers, can you explain why the year 2010 in "January 1, 2010" really is 2010 and not 2009? (Hint, you can't pick years at random.)
# 3. Write some more lists and work out similar indexes until you can translate them.
# 4. Use Python to check your answers to this as well.
