Here's what you do:

1. Go to bitbucket.org with your favorite web browser and search for "python".
2. Avoid any project with "Python 3" mentioned. That'll only confuse you.
3. Pick a random project and click on it.
4. Click on the Source tab and browse through the list of files and directories until you find a .py file (but not setup.py, that's useless).
5. Start at the top and read through it, taking notes on what you think it does.
6. If any symbols or strange words seem to interest you, write them down to research later.

That's it. Your job is to use what you know so far and see if you can read the code and get a grasp of what it does. Try skimming the code first, and then read it in detail. Maybe also try taking very difficult parts and reading each symbol you know outloud.

Now try several three other sites:

- github.com
    - https://github.com/fabric/fabric
- launchpad.net
    - https://launchpad.net/autokey - http://autokey.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
- koders.com

On each of these sites you may find weird files ending in .c so stick to .py files like the ones you have written in this book.

A final fun thing to do is use the above four sources of Python code and type in topics you are interested in instead of "python". Search for "journalism", "cooking", "physics", or anything you are curious about. Chances are there's some code out there you could use right away.
